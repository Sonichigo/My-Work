## Inspiration
I love ScoobyDoo and Mystery Inc. And since the Theme is also very similar to the show, i thought of making the the cryptic hunts based on the same in which the at the Final Call person wins the candy tickets that can later be redeem for candy or a seminar or a scary movie.

## What it does
It is cryptic candy hunt, user has to find the answer and move to next level!

## How we built it
Built using HTML. CSS, JS, and Express

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It's a full fledged game that can be played from anywhere and anytime.

## What's next for Trick-or-Treat
A story mode is on the way, with the addition of redeem shop and rank!
