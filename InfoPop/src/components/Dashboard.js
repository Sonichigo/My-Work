        <h2>India</h2>
        <p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the Indian subcontinent.<br/>
            <br/>India is socially, culturally, and linguistically very diverse. Hindi and English are widely spoken and recognised for official purposes.Other than than, there are 22 scheduled languages recognised by the constitution of India.<br/><img src='https://www.relocatemagazine.com/media/images/India-culture_12865.jpg' style={{width:'300px',height:'200px'}}/> <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/509/1*JSlWu0nQeQ5TVMY9PIBGtQ.jpeg" style={{width:'300px',height:'200px'}}/>
            <br/>However, more than 400 languages and dialects in India are still not known.
            Modern India stands as one of the most diverse countries in the world, a subcontinent that is home to over 100 languages, over 700 different tribes, every major religion in the world, and to some of the world's largest cities as well as remote regions with almost no people.

        The United States has its own distinct social and cultural characteristics, such as dialect, music, arts, social habits, cuisine, and folklore, otherwise known as Americana.

America is an anglophone country which practices Anglo-American common law.

          <br/>A century and a half of white domination in most of the country (more than three centuries in the Western Cape) and the great extent of its ties to the global market economy have profoundly transformed Black culture in South Africa.
